    "This lab introduces the Rational Speech Act model, which is a way of doing Bayesian modelling of pragmatic inference and rational behaviour during communication. The RSA model is potentially very general, but here we are going to use it to model pragmatic word use, and see how pragmatic speakers and listeners can go beyond literal word use to facilitate communication. Our model of word meaning builds on the model we used in Lab 2; now we are going to move beyond single words to (very small!) lexicons, and model inference during communication rather than learning."

[Mainly a coding problem] There's no reason to stop at a pragmatic listener who reasons about a pragmatic speaker who reasons about a a literal listener - we could happy model a *level two* pragmatic speaker (a pragmatic speaker who reasons about a pragmatic listener), and a *level two* pragmatic listener (a pragmatic listener who reasons about a level two pragmatic speaker), or even higher levels of pragmatic recursion. Either adapt the code for `pragmatic_speaker` and `pragmatic_listener` to produce code for `level_two_pragmatic_speaker` and `level_two_pragmatic_listener` (which should be relatively straightforward) or (more ambitiously), write two recursive functions, `level_n_pragmatic_speaker` and `level_n_pragmatic_listener` which can handle *any* level of recursion. Using either of these techniques, what happens when we model higher and higher levels of pragmatic reasoning? "

    "4. [Hard] Our `literal_listener` and `literal_speaker` functions are models of how a (literal or pragmatic) speaker would speak given a particular lexicon: in other words, it's modelling a likelihood, $p(data|lexicon)$, where data is a pairing of intended referents and words. Think about how you could use this as the basis for a model of word learning where the learner's task is to infer an entire lexicon based on the productions of a speaker using that lexicon (Hint: to do this you need to decide what the hypothesis space is and what the prior is). Is learning easier or harder when you learn from a literal or pragmatic speaker? If you are feeling brave, implement the model, otherwise have a think about what kinds of challenges a learner learning from a pragmatic speaker might face when it comes to inferring the \"correct\" (i.e. same as the teacher's) word meanings."
